# Library Data
## Review
This is an online library, a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application 
where users can add, edit, and delete person cards and books. 
They can also assign books to specific individuals. Or just search books. This application is deployed 
on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and can be accessed 
through the provided [link](http://mylibrary-env.eba-6fniism4.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com). 
It provides a user-friendly 
and efficient way to manage and organize library resources.
