Welcome to my second library

It is deployed on AWS EC2. Try to use it: http://mylibrary-env.eba-6fniism4.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com

Here I used Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate Validator

Here you can add, edit, search or delete books

Create, edit or delete people

And assign or release book for a person
